### Hi there 👋

I believe that my software should:

- 🐱‍💻 let me **change** it to fit my needs
- 🛫 let me work **offline** 
- 📦 give me **control** over my stuff
- 🔌 **integrate** with other software

Recently I've put most of my energy into the repos at [@local-first-web](https://github.com/local-first-web):

- [@localfirst/state](https://github.com/local-first-web/state) is an automatically replicated Redux store that gives your app offline capabilities and secure peer-to-peer synchronization superpowers.
- [@localfirst/auth](https://github.com/local-first-web/auth) provides decentralized authentication and authorization for team collaboration, using a secure chain of cryptographic signatures.
- [@localfirst/relay](https://github.com/local-first-web/relay) is a tiny service that helps local-first applications connect with peers on other devices. It can run in the cloud or on any device with a known address.

I'm the founder and CEO of [DevResults](https://www.devresults.com), a small, distributed, bootstrapped company that makes monitoring and evaluation software used by international aid projects. I was born in the US, grew up in Panama and Ecuador, and taught math in Gabon and Guinea as a Peace Corps volunteer. I've lived in Barcelona since 2016.
